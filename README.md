# KATA - TIC TAC TOE

## RULES

The rules are described below :

-X always goes first.
-Players cannot play on a played position.
-Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:
  -> One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
  -> All nine squares are filled.
- If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.
- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

## GIT

I use Github because I know it and it seems correct for this exercice
I try to apply the Gitflow workflow :
- the main branch 
- the develop branch
- the feature branches
- the release branches
- tag for the version
